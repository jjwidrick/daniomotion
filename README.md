Muscular dystrophies and myopathies result from mutations to genes associated with skeletal muscle structure, biochemistry, or function.
Consequently, dystrophies and myopathies are characterized by muscle weakness and impaired mobility. 
Zebrafish (*Danio rerio*) with mutations in orthologous genes are important pre-clinical models used in the development of new therapies targeting these disorders.
Quantifying the mobility of these fish models is therefore a key step in evaluating the efficacy of novel therapeutic treatments.
